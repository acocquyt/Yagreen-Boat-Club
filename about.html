    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Born on the Connecticuit River and forged in the Redwood City sewer system, Yagreen Boat Club (YGBC) is a consortium of Dartmouth rowers living and training in the San Francisco Bay Area. Crosswinds don't scare us. Missing water doesn't scare us. We don't know what fear is. Yagreen.</p>
